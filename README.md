# OpenAPI Blocks

This repo contains blocks to render OpenAPI specifications using GitHub blocks. To try them yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mheap/blocks-openapi
cd blocks-openapi
yarn 
yarn start
```

When you visit http://localhost:4000 you'll see the following blocks if you're looking at a filename that ends with `.yaml`

* Elements (Stoplight)
* Lincoln
* Redoc
* Swagger UI
